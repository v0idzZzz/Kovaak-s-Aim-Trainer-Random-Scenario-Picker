# Kovaak-s-Aim-Trainer-Random-Scenario-Picker

Hello and welcome to Kovaak's Aim Trainer Random Scenario Picker!

In this application, we used Kovaak's website API to fetch random scenarios for you to play. We also added 3 different game modes for you to enjoy.

First Try Challenge: It picks a scenario you haven't played before and you try to get into the percentile you chose the difficulty on. Easy is Top %75, Medium is Top %50 and Hard is Top %15 on the leaderboard rankings.

PB Challenge: In this game mode, application chooses a scenario you have played and you try to beat your Personal Bests within the time you chose (or unlimited if you want to sit back and just grind.)

Beat The Rival Challenge: In this mode, you enter a Kovaak's website username of someone you want to snipe and beat scores of. It fetches a scenario they played and compares your scores with theirs. Time choices apply here too. You can time attack or go unlimited/


Enjoy!!!

(Note: App looks for your Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer Files only for the stats folder so it can fetch your scores faster. It never modifies anything.)
